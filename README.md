# 🎮 Prateek Tomar — Game Developer | Code Wizard | AI Explorer

Hey there! I’m a Unity game developer from New Delhi with 3+ years of crafting immersive gameplay, smart AI, and blazing-fast builds. I specialize in C#, Unity, and squeezing every drop of performance out of my code.

From FPS mayhem to endless runners, I’ve:
- 🚀 Boosted frame rates by 25% using Unity Profiler  
- 🧠 Built intelligent enemies with NavMesh & State Machines  
- ⚙️ Engineered 50+ levels using MVC & Object Pooling  
- 💸 Integrated ads & IAPs that actually increase revenue  
- 🎮 Helped teams ship scalable games with clean architecture

But I don’t stop at games — I’m also deeply passionate about AI. I'm constantly exploring how to leverage it to the fullest.  
🧘‍♂️ Built [ArthaChat.com](https://arthachat.com) — a Vedic, spiritual AI chat experience (and many more projects are in the pipeline!)

Let’s build something awesome — whether it's with pixels or prompts.
